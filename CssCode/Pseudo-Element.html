      According to insights from the New York Times, Apple's top executives
      concluded last year that Siri requires a major overhaul to remain
      competitive. This realisation was prompted by the capabilities
      demonstrated by AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT in handling a wide range
      of tasks. Particularly, the ability to understand context in language,
      enabling users to pose vague queries and still receive accurate responses,
      was deemed a significant advancement. Sources familiar with the matter
      noted that Apple is actively working on integrating AI capabilities into
      Siri.
